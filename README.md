# David Fifer - Projects
Resumes are a brief quantification of a developer.  Websites and applications can provide concrete examples of a developer's skills.  Below is a sampling of my academic, professional, and personal projects.

## Personal

### Resumaker
Resume writing is a pain.  It is even more painful when it is updated and the formatting breaks.  After migrating my resume to LaTeX in college, my next big revamp came with React.  Completely separating content from layout, this let me create an abstract resume and apply styling.  The power of CSS lets me provide different web and print layouts, easily allowing me to print resumes in a print-friendly layout.

My resumaker-genrated resume can be viewed [here](https://fiferdc.github.io/resumaker/).

### Wuburgh
After playing Magic: The Gathering for several years, I amassed a large collection of cards.  Having used a variety of sites for inventory tracking, deck building, and playtesting, I thought I'd finally give it a crack and build my own.  This site is early in development and is intended to also serve as a sandbox for learning new skills.

## Professional

### LifeOmic - LIFE Extend Fitbit App
I was the sole developer of the LIFE Extend app for Fitbit versa trackers.  This started as a hackathon project to allow a user to easily update LIFE Points from the tracker.  After diving deep into UI/UX development, the app was polished and released publicly.

The app can be viewed [here](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/da9f2e8a-593e-4d7b-8883-0e98c9d8b4eb).

## Academic

### Structured Light Photogeometric Reconstruction
My CS635 final project at Purdue.  The intent of this project was to use a projector and a camera to reconstruct 3D models.  While photogeometric reconstruction was not new to the CGVLab, I wanted to focus on the camera calibration portion.  By using two colored strucutred light patterns on a non-checkboard image, I was able to complete camera calibration in only two photos.  A series of binary structured light patterns was then projected on to the scene to complete the actual photogeometric reconstruction of a non-specular object.

A demo of the application can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGEeuD1U_w4).  The unpolished code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/fiferdc/CS635).
